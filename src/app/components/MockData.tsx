    text: "Here's Margo, my eldest. She's clever, strong-willed, and far too mature for her age. Always the voice of reason, especially when it comes to keeping Edith and Agnes in check. She has a heart of gold, though sometimes, she thinks I'm a little… *unconventional*. But that's okay—she doesn't need to understand my genius. She cares deeply for her family and has an incredible sense of responsibility. Margo has grown up so much, but I will always see her as my little girl, no matter how old she gets.",

    text: "Edith, my little wild one. She's fearless, full of energy, and always looking for the next adventure—often one that gets her into trouble. She's a master at mischief, and while she may not always follow the rules, her boldness keeps things interesting. But beneath all that energy, she has a heart of gold and always stands up for her family. If there's ever a problem, Edith is the one you want by your side… though, be prepared for chaos.",

    text: "And then, there's Agnes. My sweet, innocent little Agnes. She is the most adorable thing in the world, with her big eyes and endless love for unicorns. Don't let her cuteness fool you, though—she's strong and determined when it matters most. Agnes may be the youngest, but her love for her family is pure and boundless. She's got a heart that could melt the coldest of villains, and she's always there to remind us of the simple joys in life.",

    text: "Ah, the baby, Denise. What can I say about our little bundle of joy? It's still early days, but I can already tell—this little one is going to be as unpredictable as the rest of the family. Tiny, but mighty, and already capturing my heart in ways I never expected. I may be the evil genius, but this little one is a reminder that family is the true strength of any villain. It's hard to imagine life without them now.",

    text: "Lucy, my wife. She's... unexpected. When she first entered my life, I didn't know what to make of her. But now, I can't imagine life without her. She's brave, smart, and not afraid to be a little crazy—exactly what I needed. And while she may have a slightly unconventional way of doing things, she always has our family's best interest at heart. I'm lucky to have her by my side. Even if she has a slight obsession with unicorns... which I can live with.",

    text: "I can't forget Dr. Nefario... my loyal minion and genius inventor. He's been with me through thick and thin, even when my plans weren't exactly... well, successful. He's a bit old-fashioned, but his scientific brilliance is unmatched. Sure, he's had his moments of doubt and has switched sides more than once, but deep down, he knows where his true loyalty lies. Without him, I wouldn't have half the gadgets I do—well, maybe. But honestly, he's family now, and I wouldn't trade him for anything.",

    text: "Ugh...Kyle. I never expected to have a dog, but this one... he's something else. I'm not sure if he's more trouble than he's worth or if he's just a lovable disaster. He's got this strange, mysterious vibe—always growling at nothing and chewing on things that definitely shouldn't be chewed. But deep down, I know he's loyal. Even if he's a little strange, he's family now. And I suppose, in his own way, he has a knack for making life more... interesting. Just don't let him near my shoes again.",

    text: "Oh, the goat... sigh. This little creature has more personality than any of my minions. At first, I thought - What is this nonsense? A goat? - But now, I have to admit—there's something charming about it. Sure, it eats everything in sight, including my important blueprints, but it's part of the family. It has a way of cheering everyone up with its... eccentric behavior. It's not quite as evil as I'd like, but it's a good companion. Just don't let it near my lab again, okay?",
