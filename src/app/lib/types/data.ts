They will spend HOURS trying to figure out what's wrong, and by the time they do… I will already be sipping lemonade on my secret volcano lair! Mwahaha!",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    plan: "This is my most devious plot yet! I will build a giant shrink ray, sneak into ${name}'s house, and shrink their ${item} to the size of a peanut! They will lose it forever, searching high and low, while I sit back and laugh! And then—oh wait, what if I shrink it too much and lose it too? Hmm... maybe I need a backup plan.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    plan: "Picture this! I am going to invent a machine that can turn anything into JELLY. Then, I will use it on ${item} belonging to ${name}. Imagine their face when they go to use it, and instead—SQUISH—it's just jelly! Nobody will suspect a thing… except maybe the Minions, but they'll just eat it.",

    plan: "Ah, yes, my masterpiece! I will switch out ${name}'s precious ${item} with a perfect replica made entirely of bananas! At first, they will not notice… but then, as time goes on, it will slowly ripen… and SQUISH! Their confusion will be glorious! Also, I should keep the Minions away from this one, or it won't last long.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    plan: "Behold! I shall create a hypnotic ray and use it on ${name} so that every time they see their ${item}, they MUST burst into an uncontrollable evil laugh! They will have no idea why, and soon, people will start calling THEM the villain instead of me! Ah-ha! Brilliant!",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    plan: "Ah-ha! I shall replace ${name}'s beloved ${item} with a self-replicating version! Every time they put it down, another one appears! Soon, they will be buried under an endless sea of their own possessions! And I, Gru, will be responsible for the most organized chaos the world has ever seen!",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    plan: "A most diabolical plan! I shall create a voice-changing device and attach it to ${name}'s ${item}. Every time they use it, it will respond in MY voice, demanding things like cookies and belly rubs! Confusion, chaos, and possibly free cookies—this is genius!",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    plan: "Ohoho! This one is brilliant. I will sneak into ${name}'s house in the dead of night and flip their ${item} upside down. It seems harmless, but imagine their confusion! Is it broken? Is it a glitch? Or is it… an EVIL PLOT?! They will never know!",
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    plan: "Yes, yes! This is the one! I shall create an invisibility spray and use it on ${name}'s ${item} just before they need it most! They will look EVERYWHERE, growing more and more frantic, while I stand in the shadows, stroking my imaginary evil cat, reveling in my brilliance!",
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    plan: "Ah-ha! The pinnacle of mischief! I shall swap ${name}'s ${item} with a version that sings The Minions Banana Song every time they touch it. No way to stop it, no way to escape it! It will be the most annoying, yet strangely catchy, evil plan EVER! Mwahaha!",
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    plan: "Ah-ha! I shall make ${item} of ${name} grow 10 times its normal size! They won't be able to carry it, and it will cause them endless confusion! They'll never suspect that the real evil is in the size—MWAHAHA!",
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    plan: "Aha! I will swap out ${name}'s ${item} with one that looks exactly the same but is filled with a million tiny, tiny frogs! They won't know what hit them when they open it, and I will laugh from the shadows! Ribbit… ribbit!",
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    plan: "Ohoho! This plan is diabolical! I will glue ${item} to ${name}'s hand, making it impossible for them to put it down! They will be stuck with it, and I shall watch them squirm, trying to figure out why they can't let go!",
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    plan: "Ah! I will replace ${name}'s ${item} with one that is exactly the same, but it will emit a high-pitched sound every time they touch it! Nobody will know what's happening, but they will think they are going insane!",
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    plan: "Minion plan, minion plan! I make ${name}'s ${item} be a banana! But no, wait... this banana will never peel! They will be confused! Mwahaha!",
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    plan: "Hoohoo! This is pure evil! I will give ${name} a duplicate ${item}, but this one will explode into confetti every time they try to use it! They won't be able to use it without a shower of party decorations!",
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    plan: "Oooohohoho! I shall create a mirror version of ${item} that reflects every movement but in reverse! ${name} will spend HOURS trying to figure out why they can never use it correctly. And meanwhile, I'll be enjoying the chaos!",
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    plan: "Mwahaha! I will use a cloning machine to create endless versions of ${item} in ${name}'s house! Every time they look for one, there will be 100 more popping up everywhere! The horror!",
  },
  {
    id: 19,
    plan: "Hee-hee! My next plan is simple yet effective! I will secretly switch ${name}'s ${item} with a completely identical one… that's cursed! Every time they touch it, it will make them break into dance moves! They won't be able to stop! Mwahaha!",
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    plan: "Bello! I make ${name}'s ${item} sing 'Ba-na-na!' every time it gets touched, in MINION language! The chaos will be insane, and they won't be able to get rid of it! I will laugh and laugh! Ba-na-na!",
